A schema is a logical container inside a database that groups objects like tables, views, and functions.
•	Think of a schema as a section in a library, like "Science" or "History," organizing books (tables).
•	Many databases have a default schema (like dbo in SQL Server, public in PostgreSQL).
    Example in SQL (creating a schema):
                      CREATE SCHEMA HR;
