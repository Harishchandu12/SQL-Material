A table is a collection of related data organized in rows (records) and columns (fields).
•	Think of a table as a spreadsheet.
•	Each column has a data type (integer, text, date, etc.).
        Example (creating a table):
               CREATE TABLE Employees (
               EmployeeID INT,
               FirstName VARCHAR(50),
               LastName VARCHAR(50),
               HireDate DATE
         );
