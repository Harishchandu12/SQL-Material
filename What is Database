Database

•	Definition: A database is an organized collection of structured data stored electronically in SQL Server. It groups schemas, tables, views, procedures, and other objects.
•	Purpose: Acts as a container to store and manage related data for an application.

                      Example:  CREATE DATABASE HospitalDB; 

       "In SQL Server, a database is the highest-level container that stores and organizes all the data and objects.
Inside a database, you can have multiple schemas, which act like logical folders or namespaces.
Each schema contains database objects such as tables (to store data), views (to represent data in a certain way), and stored procedures (to perform operations or business logic).
This structure helps in organizing objects, controlling access, and avoiding naming conflicts."

Example in SQL
-- Create a database
CREATE DATABASE HospitalDB;
GO

-- Create schemas
CREATE SCHEMA Medical;
CREATE SCHEMA Finance;
GO

-- Create tables inside schemas
CREATE TABLE Medical.Patient (
    PatientID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name NVARCHAR(100),
    DOB DATE
);

CREATE TABLE Finance.Billing (
    BillingID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    PatientID INT,
    Amount DECIMAL(10,2)
);

-- Create a view in Medical schema
CREATE VIEW Medical.ActivePatients AS
SELECT PatientID, Name 
FROM Medical.Patient
WHERE DOB IS NOT NULL;

-- Create a stored procedure in Finance schema
CREATE PROCEDURE Finance.GenerateInvoice
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM Finance.Billing;
END;
