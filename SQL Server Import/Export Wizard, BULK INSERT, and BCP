üß† SQL Server Import/Export Wizard, BULK INSERT, and BCP
üîπ 1. Overview

In real-world database environments, we often need to move large volumes of data between systems ‚Äî for example:

Importing data from CSV/Excel into SQL Server.

Exporting data from SQL Server for sharing or backup.

Performing ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) operations efficiently.

SQL Server provides multiple options to perform data import/export operations:

Method	Tool Type	Description
Import/Export Wizard	GUI Tool	User-friendly wizard for quick import/export tasks
BULK INSERT	T-SQL Command	High-speed import of text/CSV files into SQL Server
BCP (Bulk Copy Program)	Command-line Tool	Import/export data between files and SQL Server
üîπ 2. Import and Export Wizard
What is It?

The SQL Server Import and Export Wizard is a graphical interface that helps you quickly move data between different data sources ‚Äî without writing code.

Launch Methods

You can start the wizard from:

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) ‚Üí Right-click database ‚Üí
Tasks ‚Üí Import Data or Tasks ‚Üí Export Data

Command Line:

dtswizard.exe


Integration Services (SSIS) environment (it creates SSIS packages behind the scenes)

Supported Data Sources

SQL Server

Oracle

MySQL

Excel

Flat file (CSV, TXT)

Access (.mdb)

ODBC sources

Azure SQL Database

Steps in Import/Export Wizard

Choose a Data Source

Example: Flat File, Excel, SQL Server.

Provide connection details.

Choose a Destination

Target SQL Server database or file.

Select Tables or Write Query

You can import full tables or filter with custom SQL queries.

Specify Data Mapping

Map columns and data types between source and destination.

Save and Execute

Run immediately or save as an SSIS package for scheduling.

Example Scenario

Goal: Import data from a CSV file (Sales2025.csv) into SQL Server table dbo.SalesData.

Steps:

Right-click your database ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí Import Data

Source: Flat File ‚Üí Select file C:\Data\Sales2025.csv

Destination: SQL Server Native Client ‚Üí Select your database

Map columns automatically

Finish ‚Üí Data gets imported into dbo.SalesData

‚úÖ Quick, no scripting required
‚ö†Ô∏è Not suitable for automation or very large datasets (use SSIS or BULK INSERT instead)

üîπ 3. BULK INSERT Command
What is BULK INSERT?

BULK INSERT is a T-SQL command used to quickly import data from a file (CSV, TXT) into a SQL Server table.

It‚Äôs ideal for:

High-speed data loads

Flat file imports

Automation (via scripts or stored procedures)

Basic Syntax
BULK INSERT [TableName]
FROM 'FilePath'
WITH (
    FIELDTERMINATOR = ',',
    ROWTERMINATOR = '\n',
    FIRSTROW = 2
);

Example 1: Load CSV File

File: C:\Data\SalesData.csv

SalesID,Product,Quantity,Price
1,Laptop,3,550
2,Mouse,10,20
3,Monitor,2,300


SQL Command:

BULK INSERT dbo.SalesData
FROM 'C:\Data\SalesData.csv'
WITH (
    FIELDTERMINATOR = ',',
    ROWTERMINATOR = '\n',
    FIRSTROW = 2
);


‚úÖ Imports data into dbo.SalesData table quickly.
‚ö†Ô∏è The file must be accessible from the SQL Server machine (not your local machine if SQL Server is remote).

Example 2: Use FORMATFILE (Optional)

If file has complex structure, use a format file (.fmt) describing field and row mappings.

BULK INSERT dbo.SalesData
FROM 'C:\Data\SalesData.txt'
WITH (
    FORMATFILE = 'C:\Data\SalesData.fmt'
);

Example 3: Handling Errors and Logging
BULK INSERT dbo.SalesData
FROM 'C:\Data\SalesData.csv'
WITH (
    FIELDTERMINATOR = ',',
    ROWTERMINATOR = '\n',
    ERRORFILE = 'C:\Data\SalesData_Error.log'
);


‚úÖ Error rows get logged for review.

Permissions Required

To run BULK INSERT:

User must have ADMINISTER BULK OPERATIONS or BULKADMIN role.

The file path must be accessible to the SQL Server service account.

Advantages

‚úÖ Very fast for large data loads
‚úÖ Supports logging and format files
‚úÖ Can be run in stored procedures

Limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è File path must be local to SQL Server instance
‚ö†Ô∏è Limited transformation capabilities (use SSIS for that)
‚ö†Ô∏è No automatic rollback on failure (use transactions if needed)

üîπ 4. BCP (Bulk Copy Program)
What is BCP?

BCP (Bulk Copy Program) is a command-line utility for importing/exporting data between SQL Server and data files.

It‚Äôs similar to BULK INSERT but can:

Export data out of SQL Server,

Import data into SQL Server,

Be used for scripting and automation.

BCP Syntax
Export Data (Out of SQL Server):
bcp [Database].[Schema].[Table] out "C:\Data\SalesData.csv" -c -t, -T -S ServerName

Import Data (Into SQL Server):
bcp [Database].[Schema].[Table] in "C:\Data\SalesData.csv" -c -t, -T -S ServerName

Option	Description
in / out	Import or Export direction
-c	Character mode (default text encoding)
-t	Field terminator (e.g., comma ,)
-T	Use Windows Authentication
-U / -P	SQL Login username/password
-S	Server name
-F / -L	First and last row
-b	Batch size (number of rows per commit)
Example 1: Export Data to CSV
bcp AdventureWorks2022.dbo.Person out "C:\Data\Person.csv" -c -t, -T -S DESKTOP-SQL01


‚úÖ Exports data from table Person to Person.csv.

Example 2: Import Data from CSV
bcp AdventureWorks2022.dbo.SalesData in "C:\Data\SalesData.csv" -c -t, -T -S DESKTOP-SQL01


‚úÖ Imports CSV into SQL Server table.

Example 3: Export Query Result
bcp "SELECT Name, City FROM AdventureWorks2022.dbo.Customer" queryout "C:\Data\Customer.csv" -c -t, -T -S DESKTOP-SQL01


‚úÖ Executes query and exports results to CSV file.

Example 4: Using Format Files
bcp AdventureWorks2022.dbo.SalesData format nul -c -f "C:\Data\SalesData.fmt" -T -S DESKTOP-SQL01


‚úÖ Creates a format file describing file structure ‚Äî useful for recurring jobs.

üîπ 5. BULK INSERT vs BCP
Feature	BULK INSERT	BCP
Type	T-SQL Command	Command-Line Tool
Can Export Data?	‚ùå No	‚úÖ Yes
Can Import Data?	‚úÖ Yes	‚úÖ Yes
Transformation Support	‚ùå None	‚ùå None
Performance	Very High	Very High
Automation	SQL Agent Jobs / Procedures	OS Scripts / Batch Files
Security	Requires SQL-level permissions	Requires file and login access
Typical Use	Server-side ETL	Client-side or remote automation
üîπ 6. Real-World Scenarios
Scenario 1 ‚Äì Bulk Load Daily Sales Files

Daily Sales20251013.csv arrives in folder C:\Data\Inbound\.

You need to load it quickly into SalesDW.dbo.FactSales.

Solution:

BULK INSERT SalesDW.dbo.FactSales
FROM 'C:\Data\Inbound\Sales20251013.csv'
WITH (
    FIELDTERMINATOR = ',',
    ROWTERMINATOR = '\n',
    FIRSTROW = 2
);


Automate this via SQL Agent or SSIS.

Scenario 2 ‚Äì Export Large Table for Data Sharing
bcp CompanyDB.dbo.Employee out "D:\Exports\EmployeeData.csv" -c -t, -T -S PROD-SQL01


Then send the file to the analytics team.

Scenario 3 ‚Äì Using Wizard for Quick Testing

If you want to test import from Excel without scripting:

Use Import Wizard (SSMS ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí Import Data)

Map Excel columns to SQL table

Save as SSIS package for reuse

üîπ 7. Performance Tuning Tips

‚úÖ Use simple recovery model during bulk load (for faster logging)
‚úÖ Disable non-clustered indexes during import (rebuild later)
‚úÖ Use batch size in BCP (-b 5000)
‚úÖ Pre-size target tables (avoid autogrow delays)
‚úÖ Use TABLOCK hint in BULK INSERT for minimal logging
‚úÖ Store data files on the same drive as SQL data files for faster IO

Example:

BULK INSERT dbo.SalesData
FROM 'C:\Data\SalesData.csv'
WITH (
    FIELDTERMINATOR = ',',
    ROWTERMINATOR = '\n',
    TABLOCK
);

üîπ 8. Common Errors & Fixes
Error	Cause	Fix
"Cannot open file..."	Path not accessible	Ensure SQL Server service has file permissions
"Invalid column length"	Mismatch in file/table columns	Verify file structure
"Login failed"	Wrong authentication in BCP	Use -U and -P or -T
"String truncation"	Data size mismatch	Match column lengths with file data
