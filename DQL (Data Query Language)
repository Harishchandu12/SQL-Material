DQL (Data Query Language) is used to query (retrieve) information from a database.

👉 It focuses on reading data, not modifying or deleting it.
It helps users ask questions about data and get meaningful results.

🔹 Main DQL Command
Command	Purpose
SELECT	Used to retrieve data from one or more tables

✅ In short:

DQL = The “reading” part of SQL — it uses only the SELECT statement.

🔹 Syntax of SELECT Statement
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column ASC|DESC;

🔹 Example Table: Employees
EmpID	EmpName	Department	Salary
1	John	HR	50000
2	Alice	IT	70000
3	Bob	IT	60000
4	Eve	Finance	55000
🔹 Examples of DQL (SELECT) Queries
➤ 1. Retrieve all columns
SELECT * FROM Employees;


📄 Fetches all rows and all columns from the table.

➤ 2. Retrieve specific columns
SELECT EmpName, Salary FROM Employees;


📄 Shows only employee names and their salaries.

➤ 3. Filter data using WHERE
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'IT';


📄 Shows only employees who work in the IT department.

➤ 4. Sort data using ORDER BY
SELECT * FROM Employees
ORDER BY Salary DESC;


📄 Displays employees ordered by salary, highest to lowest.

➤ 5. Group data using GROUP BY
SELECT Department, AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department;


📄 Shows average salary per department.

➤ 6. Filter grouped data using HAVING
SELECT Department, AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department
HAVING AVG(Salary) > 55000;


📄 Shows only departments where the average salary is greater than 55,000.

➤ 7. Use aggregate functions
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalEmployees,
       MAX(Salary) AS HighestSalary,
       MIN(Salary) AS LowestSalary,
       AVG(Salary) AS AverageSalary
FROM Employees;


📄 Performs calculations on the data.

➤ 8. Use aliases for clarity
SELECT EmpName AS Employee, Salary AS MonthlyPay
FROM Employees;


📄 Gives columns custom names in the output.

➤ 9. Combine tables using JOIN (advanced DQL)

If there’s another table called Departments:

DeptID	DeptName
1	HR
2	IT
3	Finance

You can combine both:

SELECT Employees.EmpName, Departments.DeptName
FROM Employees
JOIN Departments
ON Employees.Department = Departments.DeptName;


📄 Shows employee names along with their department names.

🔹 Summary Table
Command	                         Category                                 Purpose                                	Example
SELECT	                            DQL                         	Retrieves data from a database	           SELECT * FROM Employees;
WHERE                          	Filter rows	                                SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Department='IT';	
ORDER BY	                      Sort results	                              SELECT * FROM Employees ORDER BY Salary DESC;	
GROUP BY	                         Group data	                              SELECT Department, COUNT(*) FROM Employees GROUP BY Department;	
HAVING	                      Filter groups	                                SELECT Department, AVG(Salary) FROM Employees GROUP BY Department HAVING AVG(Salary) > 50000;	

🔹 Difference Between DQL and DML

Feature                                    DQL	                                           DML
Full Form                          	Data Query Language	                            Data Manipulation Language
Purpose                           	Retrieve data	                                  Insert, update, or delete data
Main Command                        	SELECT	                                      INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
Changes Data?	                         ❌ No	                                          ✅ Yes
Example	                            SELECT * FROM Employees;	                      INSERT INTO Employees VALUES (...);

🔹 Quick Visualization
Database
│
├── DDL → Defines structure (CREATE, ALTER)
├── DML → Manipulates data (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
├── DQL → Reads data (SELECT)
├── TCL → Controls transactions (COMMIT, ROLLBACK)
└── DCL → Controls permissions (GRANT, REVOKE)


✅ In short:

DQL (Data Query Language) is all about retrieving data from a database using the SELECT command —
It doesn’t change the data, it just queries and displays it.
