DCL (Data Control Language) is used to control access (permissions) to data in a database.

It manages who can do what â€” like who can read, insert, update, or delete data in tables.

In short:

DCL commands are about database security and user privileges.

ðŸ”¹ Common DCL Commands
Command	                                                                        Purpose
GRANT                                                        	Gives privileges (permissions) to a user
REVOKE                                                      	Removes privileges previously given to a user

ðŸ”¹ 1. GRANT
âž¤ Purpose:

Used to give access rights or privileges to a specific user or role.

âž¤ Syntax:
GRANT privilege_name
ON object_name
TO user_name;

âž¤ Common Privileges:
Privilege	Description
SELECT	Allows reading data from a table
INSERT	Allows inserting new records
UPDATE	Allows modifying existing records
DELETE	Allows deleting records
ALL PRIVILEGES	Gives all permissions on the object
âž¤ Example:

Grant permission to a user named â€˜Johnâ€™ to select and insert data into the Employees table:

GRANT SELECT, INSERT
ON Employees
TO John;


Grant all privileges on a table to a user:

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES
ON Employees
TO John;


Grant privileges to multiple users:

GRANT SELECT
ON Employees
TO John, Alice, Bob;

ðŸ”¹ 2. REVOKE
âž¤ Purpose:

Used to remove or withdraw privileges that were previously granted.

âž¤ Syntax:
REVOKE privilege_name
ON object_name
FROM user_name;

âž¤ Example:

Revoke INSERT privilege from John:

REVOKE INSERT
ON Employees
FROM John;


Revoke all privileges:

REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES
ON Employees
FROM John;

ðŸ”¹ 3. (Optional) GRANT with ADMIN OPTION (Advanced)

This allows the user to pass on privileges to other users.

âž¤ Example:
GRANT SELECT, INSERT
ON Employees
TO John
WITH GRANT OPTION;


Now John can grant the same privileges to others.

Command	                       Description	                                                       Example
GRANT	                     Gives a user privileges	                                      GRANT SELECT ON Employees TO John;
REVOKE	                   Removes privileges from a user	                                REVOKE SELECT ON Employees FROM John;

ðŸ”¹ DCL in Real Life

Think of DCL as database security control:

Database admins (DBAs) use DCL to control access.

Users get only the privileges they need (for security).

Example scenario:

Admin grants read-only access to the HR team.

Admin revokes update/delete permissions from interns.

âœ… In short:

DCL = Data Control Language
Itâ€™s all about who can access or modify what in your database.

ðŸ”¸ GRANT â†’ Give permission
ðŸ”¸ REVOKE â†’ Take permission back
