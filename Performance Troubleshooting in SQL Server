ðŸ“˜ Performance Troubleshooting in SQL Server
ðŸ”¹ 1. Introduction

Performance troubleshooting is critical to identify slow queries, resource bottlenecks, and inefficient plans.

Two powerful tools in SQL Server are:

SQL Server Profiler â†’ captures real-time events.

Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) â†’ query internal system views for insights.

ðŸ”¹ 2. SQL Server Profiler
ðŸ§© Definition

SQL Server Profiler is a graphical tool that captures SQL Server events, queries, and performance metrics in real-time.

Use cases:

Identify slow-running queries

Detect blocking and deadlocks

Capture execution statistics

Debug stored procedures and application queries

ðŸ”¹ 2.1 Key Components

Trace â†’ session capturing specific events

Events â†’ queries, SP execution, login/logout, performance counters

Columns â†’ text data, duration, CPU, reads/writes, SPID

Filters â†’ limit captured data to specific databases, applications, or SPIDs

ðŸ”¹ 2.2 Example: Capturing Long Running Queries

Open SQL Server Profiler â†’ File â†’ New Trace â†’ Connect to server.

Use Tuning template â†’ select events:

SQL:BatchCompleted

SP:Completed

Set filters:

Duration > 1000 ms

Run trace â†’ identify slow queries and high CPU queries.

ðŸ”¹ 2.3 Tips

Use server-side traces for production to reduce overhead.

Capture minimal events to avoid performance impact.

Combine with query execution plans for tuning.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Dynamic Management Views (DMVs)
ðŸ§© Definition

DMVs are system views that expose internal SQL Server state, performance metrics, and query statistics.

Real-time insight into server health, queries, indexes, and resource usage

Often used in query tuning and monitoring

ðŸ”¹ 3.1 Common DMV Categories
DMV Category	Purpose
sys.dm_exec_requests	Current executing queries
sys.dm_exec_sessions	Active sessions and connections
sys.dm_exec_query_stats	Query execution statistics (cached plans)
sys.dm_exec_query_plan(plan_handle)	Shows actual execution plan
sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats	Index usage, seeks/scans, updates
sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats	Index fragmentation info
sys.dm_os_wait_stats	Wait statistics for bottlenecks
sys.dm_tran_locks	Locks and blocking info
ðŸ”¹ 3.2 Example 1: Top Resource Consuming Queries
SELECT TOP 10
    qs.total_elapsed_time/1000 AS TotalElapsedMS,
    qs.execution_count,
    qs.total_worker_time/1000 AS CPU_MS,
    SUBSTRING(qt.text, (qs.statement_start_offset/2)+1,
        ((CASE qs.statement_end_offset
            WHEN -1 THEN DATALENGTH(qt.text)
            ELSE qs.statement_end_offset
        END - qs.statement_start_offset)/2)+1) AS QueryText,
    qp.query_plan
FROM sys.dm_exec_query_stats qs
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(qs.sql_handle) qt
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_query_plan(qs.plan_handle) qp
ORDER BY TotalElapsedMS DESC;


Explanation:

Retrieves top 10 long-running queries

Shows CPU, execution count, and execution plan

Ideal for identifying performance bottlenecks

ðŸ”¹ 3.3 Example 2: Index Usage Statistics
SELECT
    OBJECT_NAME(s.object_id) AS TableName,
    i.name AS IndexName,
    s.user_seeks,
    s.user_scans,
    s.user_lookups,
    s.user_updates
FROM sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats s
JOIN sys.indexes i ON i.object_id = s.object_id AND i.index_id = s.index_id
WHERE database_id = DB_ID()
ORDER BY user_seeks DESC;


Helps identify unused indexes or highly updated indexes

Used to drop unused indexes or rebuild heavily used indexes

ðŸ”¹ 3.4 Example 3: Detect Blocking Sessions
SELECT 
    blocking_session_id AS BlockingSPID,
    session_id AS BlockedSPID,
    wait_duration_ms,
    wait_type,
    resource_description
FROM sys.dm_exec_requests
WHERE blocking_session_id <> 0;


Identifies blocked and blocking sessions

Useful for deadlock and performance troubleshooting

ðŸ”¹ 3.5 Example 4: Wait Statistics for Bottleneck Analysis
SELECT TOP 10
    wait_type,
    wait_time_ms/1000 AS WaitTimeSec,
    waiting_tasks_count
FROM sys.dm_os_wait_stats
ORDER BY wait_time_ms DESC;


Shows where SQL Server spends most time waiting

Example: PAGEIOLATCH_XX â†’ I/O bottleneck, LCK_M_X â†’ locking issue

ðŸ”¹ 4. Profiler + DMVs: Combined Approach

Profiler â†’ capture slow queries / high CPU / deadlocks

DMVs â†’ analyze query stats, index usage, waits

Execution plan â†’ optimize queries, indexes

Maintenance â†’ update statistics, rebuild indexes, adjust queries

Workflow Example:

Profiler identifies query taking 5s.

DMV shows actual CPU/reads and wait type.

Check execution plan â†’ index seek missing â†’ add index or rewrite query.

Rerun query and validate improvement.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Best Practices

Use server-side traces or Extended Events instead of Profiler in production.

Query DMVs regularly to monitor query patterns and wait stats.

Focus on top 10 queries by CPU, IO, duration.

Combine DMVs with Execution Plans for tuning.

Avoid capturing unnecessary events â†’ reduces performance overhead.

Document recurring patterns and solutions for proactive maintenance.

ðŸ”¹ 7. Summary Table
Tool	Purpose	Pros	Cons
SQL Profiler	Capture events, trace slow queries	Real-time, detailed	Can be heavy on production
DMVs	Query internal metrics	Lightweight, queryable	Only shows current or cached data

âœ… In Summary

Profiler â†’ captures query activity in real-time.

DMVs â†’ lightweight, real-time system views for performance analysis.

Combined usage â†’ identify slow queries, index inefficiencies, wait bottlenecks, and optimize SQL Server performance.

Essential for DBAs and developers handling high-performance OLTP and OLAP systems.
